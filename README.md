## About me
I love to code and debug—especially when it means taking things apart and putting them back better.  
I’m a **Computer Engineering** bachelor student at **Politecnico di Torino** and a member of the **@pwnthem0le** CTF team, competing mainly in **pwn** and **rev**. I enjoy clean code, tiny tools, and clear write-ups. Always up for interesting bugs, hard problems, and collaborative learning.

## What I’m into
- Mostly **IT** — systems, networks, and everything in between
- **Security & CTFs**: binary exploitation (pwn) and reversing
- **Cybersecurity** — vulnerability research, hardening, tooling
- **Vibecoding** — quick scripts, fun experiments, automation


## Find me
Open an issue/discussion on any repo to reach out, or ping me for CTF collabs.
